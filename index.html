     <h3>Learn to Sing With Tips From Christina Aguilera</h3>
     <ul>
       <li><strong>Warm Up Your Voice</strong>
         <p>Warming up your voice is something everyone has to do to protect their voice. If you sometimes roll your eyes at the tedious nature of these exercises and just want to get to the good part—the song you’ve been working on—just remember that even Christina Aguilera warms up every time she sings.</p>
       </li>
       <li><strong>Protect Your Instrument</strong>
         <p>As a singer, you should protect and take care of your voice as you would any important and vital instrument. You need to mitigate the environmental stresses on your voice. The top three things Christina avoids to protect her voice are smoky, loud, and stressful environments. Christina has a few go-to items that not only help relieve vocal stress, but also combat physical and emotional stress, both of which can negatively affect a vocalist. These include hot tea, room temperature water, honey, or ricola throat drops before a show, and cold water after the show.</p>
       </li>
       <li><strong>Enunciate</strong>
         <p>In musical performance, diction is the way you pronounce lyrics and sing sounds. If the audience cannot understand what you are saying, the power and meaning of the song will be lost on them. Improving your diction can provide clarity and brightness to the words you sing.</p>
       </li>
       <li><strong>Practice to Prevent Anxiety</strong>
         <p>Performance anxiety, which is the fear that comes over you before going (or even while) on stage, is something that affects even some of the most famous singers in the world. For example, Barbra Streisand’s performance anxiety got so bad that she stopped doing any concerts or public performances for 27 years, right at the height of her career. Christina Aguilera has found her own methods to calm her nerves and stay centered before performing, like doing yoga before shows. Christina suggests surrounding yourself with people who make you feel comfortable, or to write in a journal before going on stage.</p>
